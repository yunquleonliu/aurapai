# Open License for Privacy and Transparency

This license governs the use of the Aura-PAI project and is designed to promote both privacy and transparency, extending the principles of open-source licenses like the GPL from which this project inherits code.

## Core Principles

1.  **Inheritance and Compliance:** This project respects the licenses of the open-source code it incorporates. Where conflicts arise, we are committed to rewriting the necessary code to ensure full compliance with upstream licenses.

2.  **Privacy and Transparency:** We believe that privacy and transparency are not conflicting goals. This license is designed to ensure that the user's privacy is protected while maintaining transparency in the system's operation.

3.  **Industry Precedent:** This licensing model is inspired by practices in the Integrated Circuit (IC) and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) industries, where complex licensing agreements are common.

4.  **Open Access for Individuals:** The entire project is open for individuals to download, use, modify, and redistribute, under the condition that any derivative works also adhere to a OLPT-compatible  (Open Licens for Privacy and Transparency ) license.

5.  **Code Obfuscation for Privacy:** Certain parts of the codebase related to privacy-sensitive functions will be obfuscated. This code will be fully functional and compilable but not directly human-readable in the public repository.

6.  **Community Access to Obfuscated Code:** The obfuscated code will be made available to "community members." The definition of a community member and the process for gaining access will be defined at a later date.

This license aims to strike a balance between the collaborative spirit of open source and the critical need for user privacy. We welcome feedback and contributions from the community to help us refine this model.
